# signal-record.sh - Record Signal calls with app-level audio isolation
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Records a Signal call by capturing ONLY Signal's audio (not YouTube, games,
#   etc.) plus your microphone. Other apps' audio is unaffected.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   1. Creates a virtual PipeWire sink (like a fake speaker)
#   2. Disconnects Signal (ringrtc) from your real speakers
#   3. Routes Signal audio into the virtual sink instead
#   4. Loops the virtual sink back to your speakers (so you still hear the call)
#   5. Records from the virtual sink's monitor (Signal only) + your mic
#   6. On exit, rewires Signal back to speakers and removes the virtual sink
#
#   Normal path:  Signal -> speakers
#   During recording:  Signal -> virtual_sink -> speakers (tapped for recording)
#
# VS record-call.sh:
#   record-call.sh captures ALL system audio (speaker monitor). If you play
#   music or a YouTube video during a call, it gets recorded too.
#   signal-record.sh isolates only Signal's audio stream.
#
# USAGE:
#   signal-record.sh [name]    # Start a Signal call first, then run this
#   signal-record.sh anti-drone-weekly
#   Press 'q' or Ctrl+C to stop recording
#
# REQUIRES: PipeWire, PulseAudio compatibility layer, ffmpeg
#   Signal must be in an active call (ringrtc node must exist)
#
# VERSION HISTORY:
#   v1.0  2025-01-xx  Initial version - basic virtual sink + amix recording
#   v1.1  2025-01-xx  Added echo cancellation module (echocancel_source)
#   v1.2  2025-01-xx  Added loopback so user can still hear the call through speakers
#   v1.3  2025-02-xx  Attempted amix volume fix (still ~35 dB too quiet)
#   v1.4  2026-02-21  Fix audio level: recordings were ~35 dB quieter than record-call.sh
#                     - Added volume boost on inputs (+6dB signal, +3dB mic)
#                     - Set amix weights=1 1, normalize=0 to stop 1/N attenuation
#                     - Added dynaudnorm for consistent output levels
#                     - Set explicit sample_rate 48000 on pulse inputs
#                     Target: mean volume -25 to -30 dB (was -62 dB)
